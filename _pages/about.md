Hi! I'm a graduate student and <a href='https://www.nsfgrfp.org/'>NSF Graduate Research Fellow</a> at <a href='https://physics-astronomy.jhu.edu/'>JHU</a>, where I work at the <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/'>Space Telescope Science Institute</a> as a <a href='https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/davidsen-fellowship'>Davidsen Fellow</a>. I am interested in active galactic nuclei (accreting supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies) and how they interact with their host galaxies time.

I graduated from <a href='https://astronomy.yale.edu/'>Yale</a> in 2024 with a BS in Astrophysics. Before focusing on AGN, I worked on projects in experimental particle physics and the galactic center, and you can see more details about my positions on the [cv](/cv/) page (and soon my work on the [projects](/projects/) and [research](/research/) pages).

This site is a work in progress!
