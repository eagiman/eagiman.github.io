Hi! I'm a senior at Yale studying astrophysics. I am interested in active galactic nuclei (accreting supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies) and what they can tell us about the universe over cosmic time.

I previously worked on projects in experimental particle physics and the galactic center, and you can see more details about my positions on the cv page and (and soon my work on the projects page).

This site is a work in progress!
