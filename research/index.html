These active galactic nuclei (active meaning actively accreting, galactic nuclei meaning centers of galaxies; AGN) grow behind thick obscuring layers of gas and dust. The most obscured AGN become optically-thick to Compton scattering and are known as “Compton-thick.” The Cosmic X-ray Background predicts up to half of all AGN should be Compton-thick, but a much lower fraction have actually been observed to be and few examples are known.</p> <p>This past summer, I was a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow with the <a href="https://heag.caltech.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">High Energy Astrophysics Group</a> at Caltech, where I worked with <a href="https://sites.srl.caltech.edu/~fiona/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor. Fiona Harrison</a> and <a href="https://peterboorman.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Peter Boorman</a> on confirming a <em>new</em> Compton-thick AGN. For this project, we contructed a broadband X-ray spectrum using archival observations from <em>XMM-Newton</em> and <em>NuSTAR</em>. A contaminating source prevented us from taking the spectrum of our target AGN in the hard X-ray (i.e. the more energetic observation from <em>NuSTAR</em>), so we extracted the combined spectrum and strategically fit models to disentagle them. We conducted follow-up optical spectroscopy on the contaminant and determined it to be a new quasar. We used a <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...564A.125B/abstract" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">nested-smapling</a> algorithm to fit a phenomonological model and three physically-motivated obscuration models and found the AGN to be unambiguously Compton-thick. Excitingly, we plotted the sensitivity of the instruments to this object and found it to be at the very limit of detectability, making this a useful edge-case and shedding light on why so few Compton-thick sources have been found.</p> <p>My iPoster from the 243rd AAS Meeting can be viewed <strong><a href="https://aas243-aas.ipostersessions.com/default.aspx?s=9A-A9-BA-81-BC-48-67-11-28-13-C7-E8-66-91-6A-D4" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="near-infrared-spectroscopy-of-intermediately-obscured-agn"><strong>Near-infrared Spectroscopy of Intermediately Obscured AGN</strong></h3> <p>Description in progress</p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="modeling-cool-outflow-from-the-fermi-bubbles"><strong>Modeling Cool Outflow From the Fermi Bubbles</strong></h3> <p>Description in progress</p> <p><br></p> <h3 id="searching-for-axions-with-rydberg-atoms"><strong>Searching for Axions With Rydberg Atoms</strong></h3> <p>Description in progress</p> </body></html>
